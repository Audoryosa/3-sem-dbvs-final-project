# dbvs
During third semester at university, we had Database Management Systems module. This is the final project.

For academical purposes only, I have chosen to imitate in a way "real estate agency". This project contains tables and user can interact with them throughoutly. 

Technologies used: 
- PostgreSQL
- Java Spring MVC framework
- JSP pages for front end
